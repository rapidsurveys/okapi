Data collection using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI)
tools is now the standard approach for conducting surveys and studies. A
wide range of CAPI systems are currently being used. The ability to
interface with these systems helps in the overall data process. This
package provides interface functions to CAPI systems based on the [Open
Data Kit (ODK)](https://getodk.org) technology.

<!-- ## Motivation and development history

## The ODK ecosystem -->

## What does the package do?

Currently, `{okapi}` provides functions to interface with
[ONA](https://getodk.org) via its
[API](https://api.ona.io/static/docs/index.html). The current set of
functions perform the following tasks:

1.  Authenticate with the respective servers using either an account
    password or an API token;

2.  List resources in the server available to interface with; and,

3.  Get data or resources from the server to
    [R](https://cran.r-project.org).

## Installation

`{okapi}` is not yet on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) but can be
installed from the [RapidSurveys R
Universe](https://rapidsurveys.r-universe.dev) with:

``` r
install.packages(
  "okapi", 
  repos = c('https://rapidsurveys.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

## Usage

### Authentication

### List resources

### Retrieve resources
