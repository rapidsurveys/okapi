Data collection using computer-assisted personal interviewing or CAPI tools is now the standard approach for conducting surveys and studies. A wide range of CAPI systems are currently being used. The ability to interface with these systems helps in the overall data process. This package provides interface functions to CAPI systems based on the [Open Data Kit or ODK](https://getodk.org) technology.

## Motivation and development history

## The ODK ecosystem

## What does the package do?

Currently, `{okapi}` provides functions to interface with two ODK-based systems: [ONA](https://getodk.org) and [KoboToolbox](https://kobotoolbox.org) via their respective APIs. The current set of functions perform the following tasks:

1. Authenticate with the respective servers using either an account password or an API token;

2. List resources in the server available to interface with; and,

3. Get data or resources from the server to [R](https://cran.r-project.org).

## Installation

`{okapi}` is not yet available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org).

You can install `okapi` from the [RapidSurveys R Universe](https://rapidsurveys.r-universe.dev) with:

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
  "okapi", 
  repos = c(
    'https://rapidsurveys.r-universe.dev', 
    'https://cloud.r-project.org'
  )
)
```

## Usage

## Citation

If you use `{okapi}` in your work, please cite using the suggested citation provided by a call to the `citation` function as follows:

```{r cite}
citation("okapi")
```

## Community guidelines

Feedback, bug reports and feature requests are welcome; file issues or seek support [here](https://github.com/rapidsurveys/okapi/issues). If you would like to contribute to the package, please see our [contributing guidelines](https://rapidsurveys.io/okapi/CONTRIBUTING.html).
