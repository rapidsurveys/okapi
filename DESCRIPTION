Description: Data collection using computer-assisted personal
    interviewing or CAPI tools is now the standard approach for conducting
    surveys and studies. A wide range of CAPI systems are currently being used.
    The ability to interface with these systems helps in the overall data
    process. This package provides interface functions to CAPI systems based on
    the Open Data Kit or ODK technology.
